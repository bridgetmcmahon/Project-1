# Project 1 - Greatreads

This project is a very simply recreation of Goodreads, a website used to track books you want to read, are currently reading or have already read.

## Why I made this

This project was completed as part of the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. We had one week to build a website that can be used by anyone, demonstrating our knowledge of front and back-end development.

Core requirements included:
- Have at least 3 models
- Use partials
- Handle invalid data
- Use Gems
- User login
- Deploy with Heroku

## Features
- User sign up and login
- Secure password storage
- A comprehensive book search using Google Books API
- Ability to add books to 3 different shelves
- Ability to rate books and view average user ratings

### Built With
- Ruby on Rails
- Bootstrap
- Heroku
- PostgreSQL

### Gems and APIs
Gems
- bcrypt
- rails_12factor
- httparty
- googlebooks
- cloudinary
- bootstrap
- jquery-rails

APIs
- Google Books

## Live Demo
https://great-reads-app.herokuapp.com/

## Still to Come
- Users' book rating is displayed if they have rated it
- User relationships (followers and following)
- Multi-page search results & horizontal scrolling for the shelves
- Book recommendations (being hopeful)

### Known Bugs
- Clicking on 'Add to shelf' when no shelf has been selected breaks the site
- Can't add books without an author to a shelf

## Thanks
